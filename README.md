# Deep Learning Pipeline with Transfer Learning and SVM

This repository contains an end-to-end deep learning pipeline demonstrating how to leverage transfer learning using ResNet50 for image classification tasks. The project integrates data augmentation, feature extraction, SVM classifiers, and model fine-tuning to create a robust classification system.

## Project Overview
This project illustrates the following key steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing for efficient model training.
2. Data augmentation to enhance dataset variability and model generalizability.
3. Feature extraction using the ResNet50 pre-trained model.
4. Training and evaluating SVM classifiers with extracted features.
5. Fine-tuning the ResNet50 model for end-to-end training.
6. Model evaluation and visualization, including confusion matrix generation.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes ResNet50 for extracting high-level features from images.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances dataset quality with rotations, flips, and shifts.
- **SVM Integration**: Combines deep learning feature extraction with classical machine learning.
- **End-to-End Model Training**: Fine-tunes the ResNet50 model for specific datasets.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Visualizes results using a confusion matrix.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Add your dataset to the `dataset/` directory. Ensure it is organized by class labels in subdirectories.

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment and execute the cells sequentially. Each step of the pipeline is clearly labeled:
   - Step 1: Import libraries and define constants.
   - Step 2: Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Step 3: Perform data augmentation.
   - Step 4: Extract features using ResNet50.
   - Step 5: Train and evaluate SVM classifiers.
   - Step 6: Fine-tune the ResNet50 model.
   - Step 7: Evaluate and visualize results.

3. **Evaluate Results**:
   - The notebook will generate evaluation metrics and a confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## Example Results
- **Feature Extraction**: Achieved feature embeddings suitable for SVM classifiers.
- **Model Accuracy**: [Add details once trained on your dataset]
